# Project Description
This project is a sample project of a live auction website. At the auction left-over vegetables can be purchased. Each auction currently active is shown on the hompegage. Users can place a bid. A component displays current auctions and the highest bidder for each vegetable including the time of the bid. 
Users don't need to be logged in but a username and a contact address (email) is required to place a bid. After the auction ended the system sends a notification via email to the highest bidder.
