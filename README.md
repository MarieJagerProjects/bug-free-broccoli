# AngularLiveAuction

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

# Project Description
This project is a sample project of a live auction website. At the auction left-over vegetables can be purchased. Every auction currently active is shown on the homepage. Users can place a bid for a vegetable by entering a bid when logged in or entering their biddername, a contact address (email) and the bid. After the auction ended the system sends a notification via email to the highest bidder.
